## 尼安德塔人(The Neandertals)
* 學名：*Homo neanderthalensis*
* The first fossils to be recognized as human were found in the Neander Valley in western Germany
* Neandertal remains have been recovered from a broad geographic range in western Eurasia
* The oldest record of a Neandertal comes from the site of Krapina(克拉皮納), in Croatia(克羅埃西亞), dated to 130 ka
---
* DNA analysese suggest that Neandertals were not directly ancestral to *H.sapiens*
* Instead, the two lineages **diverged from *Homo heidelbergensis(海德堡人)* about 588 ka**
* Neandertals are often popularly displayed as primitive cavemen

### Body Characteristic of The Neandertals
* shot and stocky
* An adaptation for the cold condition of Ice Age Europe
* Differences in **resource exploitation strategies** give  anatomically modern humans an advantage over Neandertals
#### 大腦比較
* Neandertals brains were as large as or larger than modern people's brains
* But they are enlarged in a slightly different way
* Neandertals：**elongate**, larger **occipital area(枕葉區)**
* mordern human：**globular**, larger **middle temporal region(顳葉區)**
* This difference appears in the first year after birth
* much stronger than extant humans
* Their front teeth showed very heavy wear, sometimes down to the roots
---
* Stone toolmakers, producing tools known as the **Mousterian tool industry**
* circular constructions of stalagmites -- the oldest constructions made by numans

* The capacity for complex speech remains controversial
* The first humans known to **bury their dead** [發現大量葬禮儀式]
* Burials(葬禮) at **Shanidar Cave in Iraq**, a variety of medicinal plants were found [花花草草為葬禮的擺飾]
* Molecular analysis has shown that the Neandertal diet consisted of pine cones, poplar(白楊), moss, wild mouflon(野生綿羊), and woolly rhinoceros(披毛犀)
* Hunting large mammals with weapons that required close contact with their prey [沒有遠距離武器，只能打近戰]
* Many skeletal remains of Neandertals show evidence of **serious injury**
* Despite the high incidence of injuries, **20% of Neandertals were more than 50 years old**

#### Competition
* There is much debate about the role of *Homo sapiens* in the disappearance of the other species of humans
* Modern *Homo sapiens* reached Durope and Asia between 60 and 40 ka
* Neandertals and the populations of *Homo erectus(直立人)* vanished between 40 and 30 ka
* The climate was changing rapidly between about 45 and 30 ka
* The resource exploitation strategies of modern humans gave them an advantage over Neandertals
* Neandertals **remain static while the environment changed**：the diets of Neandertals changed greatly over thousands of years
* Anatomically modern humans **changed their food-gathering methods**：keep their diets **relatively stable**
* Difference in the levels of material culture could have driven Neandertals to extinction
* Ex. Neandertals：short-range knives and stabbing spears
* Ex. Anatomically modern humans：have throwing spears and bows and arrows [遠程攻擊武器]
* These sudies suggest that modern humans were better adapted to the new environmental conditions

## 丹尼索瓦人(The Denisovans)
* Fragmentary remains of hominins, lived 50 ~ 100ka
* found in Dnisova Cave in the Altai Mountains of southern Siberia
* only three isolated teeth and a finger bone
* The Denisovan molars(臼齒) are **very large**, and **lack traits of Neandertal and human molars** [缺少Neandertal和現代人種的特徵]
* Sima de los Huesos hominins, 430ka (Middle Pleistocene(更新世)) [在Atapuerca Mountains, Spain]
* Recent genetic analyses show that the Sima hominins were more closely related to Neandertals than to Denisovans
* Denisovan lineage split from the Neandertal lineage about 430ka
* They are genetically distinct from the Neandertals [based on 分子生物學分析]
* However, they were contemporaneous with both Neandertals and modern humans
* A preliminary analysis of the Denisova Cave：occupied by Denisovans 50ka, by Neandertals 45ka, then by modern humans
* two crania from Lingjing, China [？問老師]

## Origins of modern humans
[Levant region](/QS-d6rkzQhOo66Nq9a3kOA)
* African origin of *Homno sapiens* is supported both by the **fossil record** and by **genetic studies of modern humans**
* **mitochondrial DNA(粒線體DNA)** and **Y chromosome(Y染色體)**
* Mitochondrial DNA is ingerited **only from the mother** [在cell質中，16000組base]
* trace to a woman who lived in Africa about 170ka, called **African Eve**
* Y chromosome is passed **only from father to son** [60 million組base，較難分析，其中2600組中就知道]
* trace to a man who lived in Africa 59ka, called **African Adam**
* The difference between the estimates(170ka vs 59ka) results from **uncertainty about the rates of mutation**
* The common ancestor of modern humans lived in Africa
* Reinforced by other genetic information：there is **more variation** in the human genome in Africa [非洲有更多的基因組變化]
* humans have only about **one-tenth the genetic variation** of chimapanzees
* human populations were once very small, passing through a **genetic bottleneck** [為什麼要在這裡特別提？]
* Recent findings of human reamins in Morocco indicate that the earliest modern* Homo sapiens* appeared there about 300ka [那個時候就已經分布在整個非洲大陸]
